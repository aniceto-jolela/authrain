Authentication rain is a website to diversify several authentication using **Django** and **Firebase**.

Used Technologies:
- django
- firebase
- render
- crispy-forms
- crispy-bulma

This website aims to make various types authentication and giving tips on good data security practices. Since the first script created on this website has been thought of `back-end` not on the `front-end`, I hope they have a good experience on the `client's side`.

#### Types of Authentication
1. user / password
2. email / password
3. Smartphone

Here is the [site]() link for those who want to take a test.

I also made the code available on [Github](https://github.com/aniceto-jolela/django-authentication-rain), for those interested in reusing one of the authentication or studying the code.
